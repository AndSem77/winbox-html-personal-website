        <p>
          My name is Andrey Semeyko and I have been programming for 10 years
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been working in the oil and gas industry for almost 20 years,
          started as a field engineer specializing in the geophysical surveys,
          in the industry commonly known as a logging engineer, and gradually
          climbed the corporate ladder. I have enjoyed many executive positions
          throughout my career in the product design, technical sales, business
          development, and strategy. Studied computer science at college, later
          on, received a bachelor's degree majoring in automation and robotics,
          and an MBA degree from the University of Liverpool. During my MBA
          program, I got inspired by the game-changing technology, the
          blockchain, and mainly focused on studying management of IT companies
          and DeFi, from both business and programming perspectives. I love
          writing code, IT, and modern technology, and I am a big fan of Apple
          computers. I love JavaScript and React, and I also love Python, when
          it comes to data science. I love to dig into customer problems and
          solve them with modern technology. I enjoy meeting new people and
          hearing new perspectives.
